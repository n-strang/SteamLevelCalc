# Steam Level Calculator
Steam account level calculator
This is a VERY old project that is incomplete, It was when I first started learning python

The intention with this program was to calculate a users steam profile level up based on the following:
1. Current steam level
2. what level you would like to achieve
3. how much each badge (xp gain) cost

This program would do simple multiplication and division to give the user a price range in USD as to how much they needed to level up
It still needs a function to automatically calculate how much xp is required per level
It still needs a way to average out steam badge prices without user input
This can be done by dividing the current level to figure out the xp needed, and multiply that by how many levels left until the goal
